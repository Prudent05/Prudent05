# 👋 Hi, I'm Ebuka Prudence Uzoama!

🎓 Honors Computer Science student at Jackson State University  
🤖 Break Through Tech AI Fellow @ Cornell Tech  
🔬 Undergraduate Researcher | Deep Learning & Computer Vision  
🌱 I’m passionate about building AI-powered solutions for health, neuroscience, and equitable tech access

---

I’m currently exploring the intersections of **AI, machine learning, and behavioral neuroscience**. As a **Break Through Tech AI Fellow**, I’ve gained hands-on experience in:
- Machine learning pipelines
- Neural networks
- Feature engineering
- Tackling real-world challenges in health, housing, and society

I’m also a research assistant working on **pose estimation with DeepLabCut** to analyze nociceptive behavior in rodents, contributing to more objective and scalable pain assessments in preclinical research. From behavioral neuroscience to socially impactful AI, I aim to build tech that matters.

💬 Let’s connect if you’re building:
- AI models for good
- Tools that address neurological or public health challenges
- Opportunities for underrepresented technologists

## 🌟 Featured Project (Break Through Tech AI Studio)

**🏡 Title:** Superhost Prediction on Airbnb Listings  
**🔍 What We Did:** Developed a supervised machine learning pipeline to predict whether an Airbnb host is a Superhost based on listing and host data.

**🛠 Tools:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Keras (Neural Network), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, GridSearchCV

**📊 Result:** Achieved over **90% accuracy** with a neural network model; used feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to compare models and optimize performance.

**💡 Takeaway:** Demonstrated how machine learning can uncover patterns in real-world data and help platforms enhance user trust and experience through predictive insights.
